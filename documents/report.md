The first thing we did was identify the different block and elements of the different pages, finding containers, cards, menus, buttons and inputs. We drew up borders between the different containers and elements as seen in the picture in the documents.

We then both started creating the HTML code for each page on different branches on Github. We decided to borrow the icons/svgs from the Finn main page and the design system. When the HTML content was in place we started working on the general structure and layout of the pages. We started with making sure we had diffrent class names for each selector we used, so we could easily include BEM and potensially rename them later.

When the layouts were mostly complete we began styling the different components of the pages, using both the existing Finn.no webpage and the fabric design system. We inspected the sourcecode to find out the pixel-sizes of cards, containers, finding the text-font url in the by searching source code. We also used the colors from the design-system for our pages, creating variables for each color. When we were happy with the result and the pages looked close to the original we moved on to polishing and renaming classes according to correct BEM naming.

This is also were we started merging the different branches together, fixing conflicts and updated the main branch to include all features.
After that we created the "demo.html" page to showcase the different components that we used on the pages.

The Login page:

When recreating the second screenshot we first started writing the html-code for the different components we needed, included all the contents of the page.
We then started creating the general structure of the page, a info-container and a login-card as the main containers of the page.
After that we started structuring the content whitin these containers. the inputfields, labels headline, buttons etc. So it looks closer to the example picture.

After that came general styling, we used the design system to find the accepted colours, how the buttons should look, shadows, font-size and borderradius.

We also used the developers tools in chrome to also fin out how wide containers should be, getting the fonts and icons for the page from their code.

Lastly there was some minor adjusting to make the pages more similar.

Our task was to recreate the front page and login page of FINN, a marketplace that offers a multitudes of services. We had to use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology and Sass, while showing a fundamental understanding of their design system during coding. It's important to know how to write reusable, maintainable and concise code that is easy to read when you are cooperating with others, and for the people taking over later on. 

The first thing we did was identify where to use BEM for naming classes by drawing lines over screenshots of the pages. We began by finding the big blocks of the page, then the multiple elements making up those blocks, such as containers, cards, menus, buttons and inputs. A couple of those elements were also similar, but we could separate them due to a few modifications.

We started creating the HTML code for each page on different branches on Github. We decided to borrow the icons/svgs from the Finn main page, and located in the "Icon" section in their design manual. When the HTML content was in place, we started working on the general structure and layout of the pages, and made sure we had various class names for each selector we used. This made it easier to include BEM, and potentially rename them later.

When the layouts were mostly complete, we began styling the different components of the pages, using both the existing webpage and their Fabric Design System for guidance. We inspected the source code to find or get an estimate of sizes of cards and containers, or things that weren't readily accessible such as their fonts. We also used the colors from the design system for our pages, creating variables for each color for consistency. After we were happy with the result due, we moved on to polishing and renaming classes that could be better specified with the use of BEM.

In the beginning, it was difficult seeing the bigger picture when it came to what were blocks. But after having to work together as a team that had to deal with each other's coding style, we quickly learned that having a naming method was necessary. With the use of some functions of Sass, such as nesting, shortcuts (e.g. '&') and variables, we wished to make code that was efficient, and followed the DRY-principle to the best of our ability. 

This is also where we started merging the different branches together, fixing conflicts and updated the main branch to include all features. After that, we created the "demo.html" page to showcase the different components that we used on the pages.
